Will you rise up to the challenge, and if so, will you use their powers against them? Only time will tell...%SPEECH_ON% Welcome to \"Path of the Vatt\'ghern\" (PoV). This is a witcher-themed mod, adding in quite a few new features, including items, events, skills, enemies and so on. The mod also tweaks existing game mechanics, like the injury system. %SPEECH_OFF% [color=" + this.Const.UI.Color.povEvent + "] Many of the mod\'s additions are explained via thematic events and items, but if you want to get brief explanation of the most important additions to this mod, and possibly keep track of some details, there is a Wiki included in PoV\'s mod settings page, in the wiki tab. For more detailed information, check PoV\'s discord server. \n\n If you dont want to see this event in new playthroughs, disable it in PoV\'s misc mod settings.\n\n Enjoy â˜º[/color]}"
